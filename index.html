			About...
		</h2>
		<p id="aboutP1">
			The goal of this site is to be the community hub for all things financial independence (FIRE). <br>
			<br>
			For some context about me, I am a 26 yr old who started reading and then becoming obsessed with all blogging, podcast, documentary, you name it investment advice and lifestyle hacks to get to financial FREEDOM!
			However, after consuming all the content I could, I felt less than satisfied with the current community in my own neighbor of Madison, WI.
			I want to bring the community together. There is something to be said about knowing your neighbor and being willing to help him or her on a Saturday clean their gutters and enjoy a beer in the evening.
			Life is better shared, so why not be the change we want to see in the world.
